                        Hello! 
        <br> I'm Mahith, I go to Quail (Jail) Valley Middle School, I'm a 7th grader there.
        <br> I'm a <b>math</b> advocate, and play <b>chess</b> as well. 
        <br> In math, my favorite subject is <b>Number Theory</b> because it's the most interesting, and it doesn't require much memorization and it's more intuition based.
        <br> In chess, my favorite opening is the <b>Halloween Gambit</b> because though you sacrifice in the beginning, it gives you a superior position.
        <br> One of my favorite coding languages is <em>LaTeX</em> as it's fun to typeset complicated equations. LaTeX is only a typesetting language however. 
        <br> I speak English, Telugu and learn Spanish in school. 
        <br> I have so much more to share with you and after reading this page...
        <br> <big> <b>And I hope you'll know all about me!</b></big>

        <br> Mahith:                                                   "No, I don't really feel like playing outside <em>right</em> now."
        <br> Anvitha:                                                  "<big>AWWW CMON</big> it's the perfect weather, you really should! You can go play basketball with them"
        <br> Narrator:                                                 "Mahith <b>reluctantly</b> agreed, after being pestered by his sister for the next 10 minutes."

        <br> Mahith:                                                   "Fine! I'll come out if you stop bothering me!"
        <br> Anvitha:                                                  "Yay! Let's go <em>right</em> now!"

        <br> Mahith:                                                   "Guys I actually have some homework to do, so I'm gonna have to go now."
        <br> Friends:                                                  "Cmon, you literally just came out!"
        <br> Mahith:                                                   "Sorry, but I gotta finish it now, my teacher set the deadline for 9 o'clock for some weird reason. UGGHH."
        <br> Narrator:                                                 "This describes Mahith's day from after 7 o'clock to about 8:30 on most days..."

        <dd style = "font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; text-align: center;">My favorite snacks are either oreo like Indian chocolate biscuits, with a chocolate filling in the middle of two chocolate biscuits. <br> I also like Little Hearts, which are small hearts coated with a layer of sugar.</dd>

        <dd style = "font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; text-align: center;">I prefer bakery fresh bread, as it has much more flavor, authenticity and tastes much better than packaged bread. <br> My favorite type of bakery bread is the three cheese bread, even though it isn't very health :P</dd>
